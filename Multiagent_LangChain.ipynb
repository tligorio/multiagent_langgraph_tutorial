    "# Multi-Agent Research Assistant with LangGraph\n",
    "#### Authored by Dr. Tiziana Ligorio for *AI Agents - CSCI 395.32* taught at Hunter College of The City University of New York\n",
    "#### Adapted from: [*Large Language Model Agents*, Jerin George Mathew & Jacopo Rossi, Springer 2025](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-92285-5_8)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we build a research assistant that uses multiple agents to streamline the process of finding and filtering academic research papers. This demonstrates a multi-agent system using the LangGraph framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system consists of four specialized agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search Agent** — Queries Google Scholar and/or arXiv to find academic papers matching the user's query\n",
    "2. **Filter Agent** — Evaluates the relevance of retrieved papers and adds relevant ones to the filtered papers list\n",
    "3. **Query Refinement Agent** — Refines the search query to improve results when the current query yields insufficient relevant papers\n",
    "4. **Supervisor Agent** — Decides whether the workflow should finalize (enough relevant papers found) or continue refining the query\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tligorio/multiagent_langgraph_tutorial/main/images/multiagent.png\" alt=\"Multiagent System - web\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stopping Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The Supervisor Agent finalizes the workflow when at least **3 papers** have been identified with a **relevance score ≥ 0.7**. Otherwise, the Query Refinement Agent generates an improved query and the search process iterates."

    "## Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Duplicate papers** — Papers may appear more than once in the final results. This happens because `filtered_papers` accumulates across iterations — if the same paper is found in multiple searches and passes the relevance threshold each time, it gets added again.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Exercise for the reader:* Modify the workflow to prevent duplicate papers. Consider deduplicating by paper URL or title in the `filter_agent`, keeping track of already-seen paper IDs in the state, or deduplicating at the end before displaying results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple search sources** — More search agents may be added to use different academic paper sources: Semantic Scholar, PubMed, OpenAlex, CrossRef, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Exercise for the reader:* Implement additional agents for different searches (e.g., `semantic_scholar_agent`, `pubmed_agent`, etc.) and modify the graph to run multiple search agents in parallel. Consider how the state schema should change, whether the filter agent should treat sources differently, and how to handle cross-database duplicates. Should all sources always be searched? What logic determines which sources to use — the research domain, the query keywords, the iteration number? Or should an LLM agent decide?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error handling and retries** — The workflow currently assumes API calls succeed. What happens if arXiv is down, rate limits us mid-workflow, or returns malformed data?\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Exercise for the reader:* Add try/except blocks, exponential backoff, and graceful degradation so the workflow can recover from transient failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Citation following** — Once relevant papers are found, expanding the search to include papers they cite (references) or papers that cite them (citations) could surface important related work.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Exercise for the reader:* Implement a `citation_agent` that takes the filtered papers and queries a citation API (e.g., Semantic Scholar) to find connected papers. How should this agent integrate into the existing graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Summarization agent** — After finding relevant papers, a summarization step could help users quickly understand the landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Exercise for the reader:* Add a final agent that synthesizes the findings: generate a research summary, identify common themes across papers, or produce a literature review outline.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **User feedback loop** — The current workflow is fully automated. Allowing user input during execution could improve results.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Exercise for the reader:* Modify the workflow to pause and ask the user to mark papers as relevant or irrelevant. Use this feedback to adjust subsequent searches or filter criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Export functionality** — Researchers need results in formats compatible with their tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Exercise for the reader:* Add an export step that outputs results to BibTeX for LaTeX, CSV for spreadsheets, or direct integration with reference managers like Zotero or Mendeley.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Checkpointing** — Long-running workflows may be interrupted. LangGraph supports persistence and checkpointing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Exercise for the reader:* Configure the workflow to save state periodically so it can be resumed if interrupted. See the LangGraph documentation on persistence."
